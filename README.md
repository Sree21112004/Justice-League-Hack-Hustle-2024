- # Medical Boolean Query Generator

This repository contains the code for a **Medical Boolean Query Generator**. This tool is designed to assist users in constructing complex boolean queries for medical literature searches, especially useful for systematic reviews and research purposes.

## Features
- **Query Generation**: Automates the creation of boolean queries based on user input.
- **Medical Terminology Handling**: Incorporates medical terms and synonyms to broaden search scope.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Uses Gradio for a user-friendly experience.

## Project Structure
- `Justice_League_Final.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the boolean query generator.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or execute the Gradio app.
