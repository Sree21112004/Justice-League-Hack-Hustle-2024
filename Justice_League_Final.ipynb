Her vital signs are stable, and she walked into the emergency department, which suggests that she is not in immediate life-threatening distress. However, the severity of her pain indicates a need for prompt evaluation and management.\\n\\n### Analysis of the Patient's Condition:\\n- **Severe Pain**: The pain is rated as 8/10, which is significant and requires timely intervention. However, severe pain alone does not automatically qualify a patient for ESI Level 2 unless it is associated with a high-risk condition.\\n- **Potential Causes**: The pain could be due to a musculoskeletal injury, nerve-related issues (such as a pinched nerve or neuropathy), or less likely, vascular problems (such as a deep vein thrombosis or arterial occlusion). Without additional information on her medical history or any recent injuries, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.\\n\\n### ESI Level 2 Criteria Consideration:\\n- **High-Risk Situations**: The current presentation does not immediately suggest a high-risk situation like acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or severe respiratory distress. The stable vital signs and the ability to walk into the ED further support this.\\n- **New Onset of Confusion/Lethargy/Disorientation**: There is no indication of any changes in mental status, which would be a concern for ESI Level 2.\\n- **Severe Pain or Distress**: While the pain is severe, it is not associated with any high-risk condition based on the information provided. The pain itself, without additional high-risk factors, does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe patient does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2 based on the current information. Her condition requires prompt evaluation and management due to the severity of the pain, but it does not appear to be associated with a high-risk situation or new onset of confusion/lethargy/disorientation.

Examples include chest pain suggestive of ACS, signs of stroke, severe respiratory distress, ectopic pregnancy, testicular torsion, and trauma with high-risk mechanisms.\\n- New Onset of Confusion/Lethargy/Disorientation: Acute changes in mental status that may indicate serious conditions like stroke, metabolic imbalances, or toxicological issues.\\n- Severe Pain or Distress: A pain rating of 7/10 or higher that is consistent with clinical findings, or severe physiological or psychological distress requiring timely intervention. However, high rating of pain does not always contribute to high-risk.\\n\\n## Short Summary of Key Assessment Points\\n- Utilize clinical judgment, considering both patient-reported symptoms and objective findings.\\n\\t Recognize symptom patterns and high-risk presentations based on your experience and knowledge.\\n- Prioritize patients who need rapid evaluation but do not require immediate life-saving interventions (which would classify them as ESI Level 1).\\n\\t Document and communicate your assessment clearly to ensure timely care.\\n\\n# Instruction\\n1.

Her vital signs are stable, and she walked into the emergency department, which suggests that she is not in immediate life-threatening distress. However, the severity of her pain indicates a need for prompt evaluation and management.\\n\\n### Analysis of the Patient's Condition:\\n- **Severe Pain**: The pain is rated as 8/10, which is significant and requires timely intervention. However, severe pain alone does not automatically qualify a patient for ESI Level 2 unless it is associated with a high-risk condition.\\n- **Potential Causes**: The pain could be due to a musculoskeletal injury, nerve-related issues (such as a pinched nerve or neuropathy), or less likely, vascular problems (such as a deep vein thrombosis or arterial occlusion). Without additional information on her medical history or any recent injuries, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.\\n\\n### ESI Level 2 Criteria Consideration:\\n- **High-Risk Situations**: The current presentation does not immediately suggest a high-risk situation like acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or severe respiratory distress. The stable vital signs and the ability to walk into the ED further support this.\\n- **New Onset of Confusion/Lethargy/Disorientation**: There is no indication of any changes in mental status, which would be a concern for ESI Level 2.\\n- **Severe Pain or Distress**: While the pain is severe, it is not associated with any high-risk condition based on the information provided. The pain itself, without additional high-risk factors, does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe patient does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2 based on the current information. Her condition requires prompt evaluation and management due to the severity of the pain, but it does not appear to be associated with a high-risk situation or new onset of confusion/lethargy/disorientation. Further assessment, including a detailed medical history and physical examination, is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the pain and appropriate treatment.\",\n          \"1. **Analysis of Patient's Condition:**\\n   - The patient is a 29-year-old male presenting for suture removal.\\n   - He is experiencing moderate pain but has stable vital signs.\\n   - The wound is healing well with no signs of infection.\\n\\n2. **Predicted Number of Resources Required:**\\n   - 0 resources.\\n\\n3. **Reasoning:**\\n   - Suture removal is considered a simple procedure and does not count as a resource.\\n   - The patient's condition does not indicate the need for laboratory tests, imaging studies, IV fluids, or medications that require significant ED staff time.\\n   - The patient's stable condition and the nature of the visit (suture removal) suggest that no additional resources are needed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Her vital signs are stable, and she walked into the emergency department, which suggests that she is not in immediate life-threatening distress. However, the severity of her pain indicates a need for prompt evaluation and management.\\n\\n### Analysis of the Patient's Condition:\\n- **Severe Pain**: The pain is rated as 8/10, which is significant and requires timely intervention. However, severe pain alone does not automatically qualify a patient for ESI Level 2 unless it is associated with a high-risk condition.\\n- **Potential Causes**: The pain could be due to a musculoskeletal injury, nerve-related issues (such as a pinched nerve or neuropathy), or less likely, vascular problems (such as a deep vein thrombosis or arterial occlusion). Without additional information on her medical history or any recent injuries, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.\\n\\n### ESI Level 2 Criteria Consideration:\\n- **High-Risk Situations**: The current presentation does not immediately suggest a high-risk situation like acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or severe respiratory distress. The stable vital signs and the ability to walk into the ED further support this.\\n- **New Onset of Confusion/Lethargy/Disorientation**: There is no indication of any changes in mental status, which would be a concern for ESI Level 2.\\n- **Severe Pain or Distress**: While the pain is severe, it is not associated with any high-risk condition based on the information provided. The pain itself, without additional high-risk factors, does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe patient does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2 based on the current information. Her condition requires prompt evaluation and management due to the severity of the pain, but it does not appear to be associated with a high-risk situation or new onset of confusion/lethargy/disorientation.

Her vital signs are stable, and she walked into the emergency department, which suggests that she is not in immediate life-threatening distress. However, the severity of her pain indicates a need for prompt evaluation and management.\\n\\n### Analysis of the Patient's Condition:\\n- **Severe Pain**: The pain is rated as 8/10, which is significant and requires timely intervention. However, severe pain alone does not automatically qualify a patient for ESI Level 2 unless it is associated with a high-risk condition.\\n- **Potential Causes**: The pain could be due to a musculoskeletal injury, nerve-related issues (such as a pinched nerve or neuropathy), or less likely, vascular problems (such as a deep vein thrombosis or arterial occlusion). Without additional information on her medical history or any recent injuries, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.\\n\\n### ESI Level 2 Criteria Consideration:\\n- **High-Risk Situations**: The current presentation does not immediately suggest a high-risk situation like acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or severe respiratory distress. The stable vital signs and the ability to walk into the ED further support this.\\n- **New Onset of Confusion/Lethargy/Disorientation**: There is no indication of any changes in mental status, which would be a concern for ESI Level 2.\\n- **Severe Pain or Distress**: While the pain is severe, it is not associated with any high-risk condition based on the information provided. The pain itself, without additional high-risk factors, does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe patient does not meet the criteria for ESI Level 2 based on the current information. Her condition requires prompt evaluation and management due to the severity of the pain, but it does not appear to be associated with a high-risk situation or new onset of confusion/lethargy/disorientation. Further assessment, including a detailed medical history and physical examination, is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the pain and appropriate treatment.\",\n          \"1. **Analysis of Patient's Condition:**\\n   - The patient is a 29-year-old male presenting for suture removal.\\n   - He is experiencing moderate pain but has stable vital signs.\\n   - The wound is healing well with no signs of infection.\\n\\n2. **Predicted Number of Resources Required:**\\n   - 0 resources.\\n\\n3. **Reasoning:**\\n   - Suture removal is considered a simple procedure and does not count as a resource.\\n   - The patient's condition does not indicate the need for laboratory tests, imaging studies, IV fluids, or medications that require significant ED staff time.\\n   - The patient's stable condition and the nature of the visit (suture removal) suggest that no additional resources are needed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5587,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"scenario 45yearold male presents emergency department chest pain appears anxious clutching chest patient reports pain started suddenly 30 minutes ago watching television describes pain heavy pressure rated 8 10 located center chest radiating left arm also reports shortness breath nausea vital signs heart rate 110 beats per minute blood pressure 15090 mmhg respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute oxygen saturation 94 room air temperature 986f 37c observations patient diaphoretic sweating profusely appears pale visibly distressed alert oriented person place time esi triage level based patients presentation including severity chest pain vital signs overall appearance patient would likely triaged esi level 2 level indicates highrisk situation requires immediate attention potential lifesaving intervention\",\n          \"31yearold white male presented emergency department chief complaint right wristarm pain arrived walkin vital signs upon arrival heart rate 106 bpm respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute blood pressure 13990 mmhg oxygen saturation 96 temperature 981f patient reported pain level 610 patient requires physical examination right wristarm assess deformities swelling limited range motion\",\n          \"67yearold white eastern european female history metastatic melanoma ckd stage iv hypertension recent acetabular fracture presenting ed confusion severe back pain pain level 8 vital signs show bp 13571 p 95 rr 18 spo2 99 temperature 966f medications including apixaban metoprolol furosemide allergies aspirin fosamax arrived walkin condition critical\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"boolean_query\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"patient AND hr OR rr NOT vomiting\",\n          \"dyspnea AND edema OR arrival NOT constipation\",\n          \"emergency AND patient OR anxiety NOT anxiety\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
